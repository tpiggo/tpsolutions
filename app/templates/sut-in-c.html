    <div id="project-description">
        A simple user level threading library for the C programming language. Using a First Come First Serve (FCFS)
        scheduling algorithm, the simple user level threads had two types of operations. Computation operations or
        IO operations. These operations were mapped to two kernel level threads namely: Compute executor and IO
        executor. For the computation operations, the user level threads were given the entire CPU in order to
        perform their task. The time of switching was left up to the task, who either ended execution or yielded the
        CPU to the next task. IO threads were blocking for opens and reads. Kernel threads must wait until all tasks
        are complete before joining the main thread.

    <div id="project-description">
        Utilizing socket programming in a low level language such as C, the remote procedure call server had two
        components: Front and back ends. For the front end, a terminal level GUI was used (very basic) where the user
        is able to call backend functions which have been exposed to them. From the backends perspective, it is
        agnostic to the number of frontend clients it has. For the purpose of deeper isolation and concurrent running,
        the use of a multi-processes backend was chosen. Every connection had a distinct process which handled the
        connection with the parent process handling the creation, maintenance and shutdown of the program as a whole.
